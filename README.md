This API is intended to be used with Reconfiguriable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) for dynamic 5G/6G wireless beamsteering in urban environments.

 This API enables communication between a Webpage (Interactive) or python script (Direct) and a Raspberry Pi to send and update the beamsteering configurations.
